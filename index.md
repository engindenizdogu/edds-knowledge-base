### Hi, I'm Engin Deniz Doğu
I'm a master's student in Machine Learning at Stevens Institute of Technology. I created this site to keep my notes organized and build my own knowledge base (and since it could also double as a portfolio, I thought, why not turn it into a documentation blog). I’ll also be using it as a personal blog. Feel free to look around — I hope you’ll find something helpful here too!

> This site was built using [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) (a Jekyll theme for documentation). I use Obsidian to write and organize my markdown notes, which I then publish directly to GitHub. If you’re curious, you can check out my notes about Jekyll in the menu.
