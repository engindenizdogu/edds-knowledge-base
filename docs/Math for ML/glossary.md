#### Probability

**Discrete Probability**
: Involves a random variable that can only take on a finite or countable number of values

**Continuous Probability**
: Involves a random variable that can take on any value within a given range

**Prior Probability**
: An initial probability assigned to an event before any new information is obtained

**Posterior Probability**
: The updated probability of an event after incorporating new evidence

#### Linear Algebra

**Linear Algebra**
: Linear Algebra is the study of vectors and certain rules to manipulate vectors.

**Dot Product**
: Dot product or inner product is an algebraic operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers and returns a single number.

**Unit Vector**
: Vector with a length of 1.

**Matrix**
: With m,n ∈ ℕ , a real-valued (m,n) matrix A is a m x n-tuple of elements which is ordered according to a rectangle scheme consisting of m rows and n columns.

**Diagonal Matrix**
: In $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ the diagonal matrix is defined as a $nxn$ matrix containing numbers on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

**Triangular Matrix**
: A triangular matrix is a square matrix with all entries either above or below the main diagonal being zero

**Identity Matrix**
: In $\mathbb{R}^{n \times n}$ the identity matrix is defined as a $nxn$ matrix containing 1 on the diagonal and 0 elsewhere.

**Symmetric Matrix**
: A matrix where the elements are mirrored around the diagonal.

**Gaussian Elimination**
: Performing elementary transformation to bring a system of linear equations into reduced row-echelon form.
