| *October 4*                 | **AI Agents Hackathon - Creators Corner** <br>Our team of three developed an AI agent designed to help users find their purpose using the Ikigai concept. We built the agent using the **OpenAI API** for dynamic conversations, and integrated **Linkup.so** as our primary search engine. We also used **DataDog** for essential website monitoring - [Ikigai \| Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/ikigai-cs4aqg?ref_content=my-projects-tab&ref_feature=my_projects)                                                               |

| *September 1-9*             | I started learning Jekyll and ended up building this blog. The setup is simple: I write and organize my notes in Obsidian, publish them to GitHub, and the site runs on a **Jekyll** theme called [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| *August 26-28*              | I worked on Kaggleâ€™s infamous Titanic competition. Since Iâ€™d never completed a Kaggle competition before, it was a great way to finally get started.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| *Short break*               | Moved to New York to pursue my Masterâ€™s at Stevens Institute of Technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| *May 4 - June 29*           | I (sort of ðŸ™‚) vibe-coded [www.eniyirestoranlar.com](https://www.eniyirestoranlar.com/) to learn how to build an online directory. The goal was to highlight high-quality restaurants. It uses the **Google Maps Places API** for restaurant data â€” but with a twist: I added a preprocessing step that filters out big chains (like McDonaldâ€™s, Starbucks, etc.) and lower-rated spots. This was more of an experimental project to see what vibe-coding a product with Cursor might look like. You can find the code in my GitHub repo. |
