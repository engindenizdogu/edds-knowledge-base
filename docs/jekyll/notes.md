### What is Jekyll?
Jekyll is aÂ **static site generator**. It processes your site by converting Markdown and Liquid files into static HTML. Any files or folders that **don't** start with an underscore (`_`) are copied verbatim to the `_site` output folder when you build your site.

Example folder structure:

```
my-jekyll-site
â”œâ”€â”€ _data
â”œâ”€â”€ _includes
â”œâ”€â”€ _layouts
â”œâ”€â”€ _posts 
â”œâ”€â”€ _site
â”œâ”€â”€ _config.yml
â”œâ”€â”€ Gemfile
â”œâ”€â”€ assets
	â”œâ”€â”€ css
	â”‚    â””â”€â”€ main.css
    â”œâ”€â”€ images
    â”‚    â””â”€â”€ logo.png
    â””â”€â”€ js 
         â””â”€â”€ scripts.js
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html (could also be an .md file)
â””â”€â”€ about.md
```

> Gemfile (publishing with GitHub)
>
> If publishing your site with GitHub Pages, you can match production version of Jekyll by using the `github-pages` gem instead of `jekyll` in your `Gemfile`. In this scenario you may also want to exclude `Gemfile.lock` from your repository because GitHub Pages ignores that file.

### Themes I Like
